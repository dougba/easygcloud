So how do you decide which messages to read? So many messages are not SPAM, yet they're not important enough to read now, or perhaps even this month. If you're spending too much time reading messages that are half way between important and SPAM, you're in inbox purgatory and need a better system. If you want to spend most of your inbox time on important mail, try using Gmail's Priority Inbox. The same fabulous system that helps Gmail users get less SPAM can also be used to train your inbox to focus on the messages that are important to you.&nbsp;<a href='\"learn\/priority-inbox.html\"'>http:\/\/easygapps.com\/learn\/priority-inbox.html<\/a><\/span><\/p>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>If SPAM is hell and inbox zero is heaven, what are you doing in purgatory?<\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":0,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"_seopress_robots_primary_cat":"","_seopress_titles_title":"","_seopress_titles_desc":"","_seopress_robots_index":"","footnotes":""},"categories":[9],"tags":[],"class_list":["post-71","post","type-post","status-publish","format-standard","hentry","category-blog"],"meta_box":[],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=71"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/71\/revisions"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=71"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=71"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/easygcloud.isatisfy.dev\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=71"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}</a></span></span>
