Their solution? Migrate years of email messages and attachments to the cloud, outsourcing their email and server needs. They chose the best-in-class email solution (Gmail) which is hosted on a worldwide network of over 1,000,000 custom built servers in secure, green, geographically dispersed Google data centers, and they chose a Certified Google Apps Reseller for deployment. Total recurring cost to Alpha Epsilon Pi? $0.00, nada, free!
