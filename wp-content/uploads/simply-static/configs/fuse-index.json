It's a good idea to archive [rather than delete] messages you may wish to refer to some day. All archived messages can be found in several different ways: in the All Mail label, in any labels you've applied to them, and in Gmail's search results. When someone replies to a message you've archived, the conversation containing that message will reappear in your inbox.

Chromebooks look like laptops but have six to eight hour battery life, and go from off to the web in eight to ten seconds!\n\n\nCloud computing\nCloud computing is internet-based computing in which large groups of remote computer servers are networked to serve resources more efficiently. This network is shared and not tied to any specific location. Cloud Computing is for software developers, application vendors, savvy computer users, and corporate IT departments, not for end-users of software applications. It basically consists of:\n\nVirtual computers\/servers\nData storage capacity\nCommunication\/messaging capacity\nNetwork capacity\nDevelopment environments\n\n\n\n\nCNAME Record\nCanonical Name or CNAME records link an alias name to another canonical domain name. For instance, www.example.com might link to example.com. You'll need to use CNAME records if you want to configure a custom URL for specific Google Workspace services or a Google Site (like sites.mydomain.com).\n\n\n\nConsumerization\nIs the growing tendency for new information technology to emerge first in the consumer market and then spread into business and government organizations.

Conversations is a term used to describe Gmail's approach to organizing messages that are sent back and forth which share the same subject. Gmail stacks all messages with the same subject in one place, making it easier to understand the context of each message and the meaning of messages as a group. In legacy email software, each message response appears separately, forcing you to wade through your entire inbox to follow the conversation. Although this may initially look confusing to Outlook users, Conversation View allows people to quickly organize their inbox and become more productive. This feature is controlled at the domain level by administrators and may also be turned on and off by individual users.\n\n\n\nCustom Logo\nYou can choose your own logo to be displayed on all services for your domain.

URL\nCustom URLs, or short URLs, make using the Internet easier. You and your users can access services with a simple, easy-to-remember address. Your custom URLs will follow this format: http:\/\/[customize this section].your_domain.com, and redirect to a login page.\n\n\n\nDirect delivery\nBy default, Google Workspace mail servers deliver incoming mail to the Gmail inbox of the recipient. If a message is addressed to a user in your domain that is not registered in Google Workspace, the mail server discards the message.\n\n\n\nDKIM\nIs an acronym for \"DomainKeys Identified Mail\". It is a method for associating a domain name with an e-mail, thereby allowing an organization to take responsibility for a message in a way that can be validated by a recipient. The validation technique is based on public-key cryptography.\n\n\n\nDMARC\nIs an acronym for \"Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance\". It is a technical standard that&nbsp;helps protect email senders and recipients from spam, spoofing, and phishing. A DMARC policy is published to request feedback from receiving email servers and to tell them what to do with messages that are not authenticated by the sending domain. DMARC builds upon both the DomainKeys Identified Mail (DKIM) and Sender Policy Framework (SPF) specifications.&nbsp;Policies include \"none\", \"quarantine\", or \"reject\".\n&nbsp;\n\n\n\nDNS\nIs an acronym for \"Domain Name System\". DNS is a hierarchical distributed database that lets you store IP addresses and other data and look it up by name. This is the system that organizes and identifies domains. DNS is the \"phone book\" of the web. While a phone book translates a name like &ldquo;Acme Pizza&rdquo; into the right phone number to call, the DNS translates a URL (like \"http:\/\/EasygCloud.com\") into an IP address (like &ldquo;74.125.239.137&rdquo;). For some Google Workspace functionality, you need to adjust DNS records of your domain. For example, DNS is used to determine where to deliver email for your domain via mail exchange (MX) records.\n\n\n\nDomain Alias\nDomain aliases are additional domain names associated with your primary domain. You can add a domain alias that receives mail and delivers it to mailboxes at your primary domain. See Basic Guide to DNS\n\n\n\nDomain Host\nDomain hosts run DNS servers for your domain. This includes A records, MX records, and CNAME records. See Basic Guide to DNS\n\n\n\nDomain Name\nDomain names are easy-to-remember names (ex. blueshirt.com or organicfood.org) that are associated with one or more IP addresses. Since a web page is defined by its URL, the page can move to a different IP address without affecting visitors. See Basic Guide to DNS\n\n\n\nDomain Ownership\nAccrues to the person or organization who registered the domain. For verification purposes administrators will be asked to prove that they own the domain name associated with a Google Workspace account.\n\n\n\nDomain Registrar\nDomain registrars sell Internet domain names (ex. blueshirt.com or organicfood.org ). Most of these companies offer a hosting service in addition to registration. See Basic Guide to DNS\n\n                    \n                                            \n                                        \n                        \n                            &laquo; Previous\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n&hellip;\n14\nNext &raquo;","excerpt":"Glossary Custom URL Custom URLs, or short URLs, make using the Internet easier.

Larry Page and Sergey Brin, the founders of Google, named their search engine after the term googol. In 1997, Larry was brainstorming names with other Stanford graduate students, including Sean Anderson, and looking at available domain names. Anderson miskeyed googol as \"google\" and found it available. Larry liked it and the name \"Google\" stuck.\n\n                    \n                                            \n                                        \n                        \n                            &laquo; Previous\n1\n&hellip;\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\n&hellip;\n14\nNext &raquo;","excerpt":"Glossary Domain Registration The process of registering Internet domain names with an accredited domain name registrar such as GoDaddy or..","path":"\/glossary-terms\/page\/5\/"},{"objectID":"309","title":"Glossary","content":"Glossary\n\n\n\nTLS\nIs an acronym for \"Transport Layer Security\".

Log in to your account prior to generating the token. Once you authenticate with a valid super administrator username and password, a token is generated. Give the token's alphanumeric code to your new Google Partner, which completes the transfer. There is no charge for transfers, however your Company may remain liable to pay Google for the remaining balance of your contract, depending on who you speak with at Google.\n\n\n\nTXT Record\nText or TXT records may contain arbitrary text but can also be used to define machine readable text. TXT records are used primarily with Google Workspace for domain ownership verification purposes. Also, you&rsquo;ll need to use TXT records to implement email abuse prevention methods such as SPF, DKIM, and DMARC.\n\n\n\nURL\nIs an acronym for \"Uniform Resource Locator\". This is the address of a resource on the Internet. For example, the URL of this page is&nbsp;http:\/\/easygcloud.com\/glossary.\n\n\n\nUser E-mail Uploads\nUsers can migrate e-mail from their old accounts into Google Workspace e-mail using the Email Migration API.

It's a free, advertising-supported email service provided by Google. Users may access Gmail as secure webmail,[1] as well via POP3 or IMAP protocols.[2][3] Gmail was launched as an invitation-only beta release on April 1, 2004[4] and it became available to the general public on February 7, 2007, though still in beta status at that time.[5] The service was upgraded from beta status on July 7, 2009, along with the rest of the Google Workspace.[6][7] With an initial storage capacity offer of 1 GB per user, Gmail significantly increased the webmail standard for free storage from the 2 to 4 MBits competitors such as Hotmail offered at that time.[8] Individual Gmail messages, including attachments, may be up to 25 MB,[9] which is larger than many other mail services support. Gmail has a search-oriented interface and a \"conversation view\" similar to an Internet forum. Gmail is noted by web developers for its pioneering use of AJAX.[10] Gmail runs on Google GFE\/2.0 on Linux.[11][12][13]\n\n\n\nGoogle Plus\nSee Google+\n\n\n\nGoogle Sites\nGoogle Sites is an easy way to create secure web pages for intranets and team projects.

The rapid release track allows users to access new features as soon as Google rolls them out to consumer users. These features have been through testing and quality assurance, but users will see them at the same time administrators do, before administrators have a chance to evaluate them for their organization.\n\n\n\nSaaS\nIs an acronym for \"software as a service\". SaaS&nbsp;is a software distribution model in which software applications are hosted by a vendor or service provider and made available to customers over a network. It's software&nbsp;delivered on a pay-as-you-go basis as a utility (like electricity) over a network (typically the Internet).\n\n\n\nScheduled release track\nGoogle Workspace users receive new features and updates automatically, without needing to install or update software, however you can still control when new features become available for users. The scheduled release track&nbsp;delays the release of new features to users, giving administrators extra time to train support staff and prepare users for the coming changes. Google releases features to the scheduled release track on Tuesdays only, at least one week after the feature was released to the rapid release track.\n\n\n\nSingle Sign-on API\nSAML-based Single Sign-On (SSO) provides full control over the authorization and authentication of user accounts that access web based applications (like GMail or Calendar).

Multiple MX records can be defined for a domain, each with a different priority where the lowest number is the highest priority. If mail can't be delivered using the first priority record, the second priority record is used, and so on. To set up email with Google Workspace, you need to point your MX records to Google's mail servers.\n\n\n\nNicknames\nA nickname is a user's alternate email address. A nickname is not a username, and it is not a separate email account.\n\n\n\nNS Record\nName server (NS) records determine which servers will hold and communicate DNS information for a domain. Generally, you should have primary and secondary name server records for your domain. If using Google Workspace, you may configure NS records with your registrar or domain hosting service that point to Google servers for DNS queries.\n\n\n\nOffline Gmail\nGmail Offline beta is a Gmail app built to support offline access, allowing mail to be read, responded to, searched and archived without network access. After first start-up, Gmail Offline will automatically synchronize messages and queued actions anytime Chrome is running and an Internet connection is available. More than just an offline app, the streamlined user interface, based off Gmail&rsquo;s popular tablet interface, provides extremely fast response time with a pure, email focused experience.\n\n\n\nPolicy Management and Message Recovery\nThis is a legacy service originally provided by Postini to Google Workspace customers. This was made available only to customers who registered for Google Workspace before August 28, 2008. \"Message Security for Google Workspace\" is the new name.\n\n\n\nPOP\nAn acronym for \"Post Office Protocol\". An application-layer Internet standard protocol used by local e-mail clients to retrieve e-mail from a remote server over a TCP\/IP connection. POP and IMAP (Internet Message Access Protocol) are the two most prevalent Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval. Virtually all modern e-mail clients and servers support both. The POP protocol has been developed through several versions, with version 3 (POP3) being the current standard. Like IMAP, POP3 is supported by most webmail services such as Hotmail, Gmail and Yahoo! Mail.\n\n\n\nPostini\nAn email, web security and archiving Company Google bought in 2007. It provided cloud computing services for filtering out spam and malware&nbsp;prior to&nbsp;message delivery, and offered optional e-mail archiving. Most of Postini's&nbsp;features are now offered natively in Google Workspace, and Google stopped offering Postini&nbsp;in 2012.\n\n\n\nPrimary Domain\nRefers to the primary domain of your Google Workspace account. You can add domain aliases to your primary domain.\n\n\n\nPriority Inbox\nPriority Inbox can help save you time if you&rsquo;re overwhelmed with the amount of email you get.

the digit 1 followed by one hundred zeros. The term was coined in 1938 by 9-year-old Milton Sirotta (1929&ndash;1981), nephew of American mathematician Edward Kasner. Kasner popularized the concept in his book Mathematics and the Imagination (1940).\n\n\n\nGoogolplex\nAnother mathematician devised the term googolplex for 10 to the power of googol - that is, 1 followed by 10 to the power of 100 zeros. Frank Pilhofer has determined that, given Moore's Law (which is that computer processor power doubles about every 1 to 2 years), it would make no sense to try to print out a googolplex until the year 2530 since all earlier attempts to print a googolplex would be overtaken by a faster computer processor.\n\n\n\nHangouts\nDeprecated - Google+ Hangouts is a communication service that replaced Google Talk, Chat in Gmail, and Google+ Messenger to create a better experience to send messages, photos and make group video calls. Hangouts is available in Gmail, Google+, on iOS or Android device, and as a Chrome extension. Hangouts is turned OFF by default for Google Workspace. Domain admins must opt-in via the admin console. After opting in, Admins can choose to opt out for the domain or for organizational units within it whenever they want. IMPORTANT: Domains that have opted-in to Google+ Hangouts cannot purchase Google Workspace Vault and you should not opt in if you plan to purchase Vault. Domains that have purchased Vault or are under data location restrictions will not be able to opt-in.\n\n\n\nHeaders\nSee full header.\n\n                    \n                                            \n                                        \n                        \n                            &laquo; Previous\n1\n&hellip;\n6\n7\n8\n9\n10\n&hellip;\n14\nNext &raquo;","excerpt":"Glossary Google Workspace Migration for Lotus Notes Complete migration of mail, calendars, contacts, and group information from your Notes accounts..","path":"\/glossary-terms\/page\/8\/"},{"objectID":"309","title":"Glossary","content":"Glossary\n\n\n\nHost\nTo&nbsp;store (a website or other data) on a server or other computer so that it can be accessed over the Internet.\n\n\n\nIMAP\nIs an acronym for \"Internet Message Access Protocol\". It is one of the two most prevalent Internet standard protocols for e-mail retrieval, the other being the Post Office Protocol (POP). Virtually all modern e-mail clients and e-mail servers support both protocols as a means of transferring e-mail messages from a server.\n\n\n\nInstant Messaging\nInstant messaging or IM is a form of real-time text communication. See chat.\n\n\n\nIP Address\nIP is an acronym for \"Internet Protocol\". IP addresses are unique numbers that allow devices to locate information on a network. See Basic Guide to DNS\n\n\n\nLabels\nLabels are a Gmail feature that enables you to identify and find your messages. Labels are similar to folders but better: you can add more than one Label to an email message or email conversation. Messages that have a Label may be Archived or may remain in your inbox. Once you've created a Label, you may view all messages with that Label by clicking the Label name along the left side of any Gmail window.\n\n\n\nLabs\nAre a collection of new features that add functionality to your Gmail account. Google's continuous innovations are presented as labs, and mature lab features eventually graduate to be incorporated into Gmail's core service.\n\n\n\nLocked Content\nAdmins can lock the left column content of start pages with important information. Users will not be able to move or edit these areas.
